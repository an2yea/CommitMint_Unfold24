What is CommitMint?

CommitMint is a web3 platform that helps you build habits and stay accountable, but with a fun twist. You set a habit you want to stick to, stake a bit of money, and get verified on your progress. If you follow through, you get your money back, plus a cool NFT as a badge of your success. But if you fall short, your stake is gone. It’s all about betting on yourself and seeing your growth pay off. Your progress is synced through verified APIs like Github with real-time tracking to ensure you are on track!

How Does It Make Things Easier?

1. Accountability with a Twist - CommitMint adds real consequences for missing your goals, which makes you more likely to stay on track. It’s like having a safety net, but one that actually motivates you to do your best.
2. High Recall Value - Web3 apps often struggle with low customer retention, with users money staked for their own interest, the dopamine rush of getting their life on track and getting rewarded for it, will ensure they keep coming back!
3. Easy Web3 Onboarding:
No need to dive deep into the complexity of web3. CommitMint gives you all the benefits of blockchain tech and NFTs, but with a super simple and approachable interface.
4. Boosts Personal Growth:
Whether you’re trying to hit a fitness goal, be more productive, or just build better habits, CommitMint makes it more rewarding. You get paid back for your effort - literally.

You can use it for tracking your Github commits for now, but we'll soon extend it to support Strava history, Leetcode submissions, headspace meditation minutes and so much more!
